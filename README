version 1.0

OVERVIEW
 Gray Area is an interactive comic book project, produced as a capstone project for the University of Maryland Honors College, Digital Cultures & Creativity.  It takes the form of an Android application for devices running version 3.0 (Honeycomb) or later. 

DESCRIPTION
 The defining characteristic of Gray Area is its location-based decision engine.  In summary, to make Decisons and progress further in the story, the user must physically move to a particular location on campus.  Thus, this application uses the Google Maps v2 API to track the user's position.  This feature is explained to the user in Tutorial.
 This version has all of the final images for our story, but a Usage Guide for editing the assets folder (to modify the Book without touching the code) is included in usage.txt. 
 Keywords:
  Panel) images that will tell the story (remember, this is a comic book)
  Chapter) set of Panels bounded by decision(s)
  Decision) point where story diverges (think Choose-Your-Own-Adventure)
  Ending) chapter without subsequent decision
  Book) the collection of Panels, Chapters, and Decisions that comprises the full story of the application
  Path) how we store chapters visited in order to implement History and Jump
  History) where users can see the text of what they've read so far without flipping through the panels
  Jump) allows users who have unlocked this feature by completing one path to jump back to previous chapters, so that they can explore other options without starting over
  Cheat) allows users who have unlocked this feature by completing one path to play the story without the location-based decision-making
  Tutorial) First Panels of Chapter 0 that describe the mechanics to the user (\grayarea\assets\tutorial-x.jpg in our case)
