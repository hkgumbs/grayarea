OVERVIEW
 Gray Area is an interactive comic book project, produced as a capstone project for the University of Maryland Honors College, Digital Cultures & Creativity.  I am developing and designing the application, and a partner is creating the content.  Currently, our main graphics and soundtrack are open-source, cited in "About."

DESCRIPTION
 The defining characteristic of Gray Area is its location-based decision engine.  In summary, in order to progress further in the story, the user must physically move to that location on campus.  In the current version of the application, this feature is slightly ambiguous because I have yet to implement the tutorial, which will exist in the full prototype.  
 Currently, the application fully implements the following features:
  - "About" 
  - "Panel"
  - "Menu"
  - "Decision" 
  - "History"
  - "Continue" 
 Yet to implement:
  - "Save/Load" functionality
  - "Original" graphics and final design

STATUS
 This version of the application is in a pre-alpha stage, a couple weeks away from being a full prototype.  It is currently an incomplete framework of the project, with filler images and text for demonstration purposes.
