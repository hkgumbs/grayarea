OVERVIEW
 Gray Area is an interactive comic book project, produced as a capstone project for the University of Maryland Honors College, Digital Cultures & Creativity.  I am developing and designing the application, and a partner is creating the content.  Currently, our main graphics and soundtrack are open-source, cited in "About."

DESCRIPTION
 The defining characteristic of Gray Area is its location-based decision engine.  In summary, in order to progress further in the story, the user must physically move to that location on campus.  In the current version of the application, this feature is slightly ambiguous because we have yet to create the tutorial, which will be a series of instructional panels in Chapter 0.
 Currently, the application fully implements every feature, and we will soon begin alpha testing (with the filler panels). In order to test more quickly, I set the decision markers at my house, and the chapters looped around.  This can be changed, however, by editing "deciisions.txt" and following the formatting conventions.  A guide to editing the .txt files will also come soon.  [NOTE: The code is messy and needs some cleaning up.]
 Keywords:
  Panel) images that will tell the story (remember, this is a comic book)
  Chapter) set of Panels bounded by decision(s)
  Decision) point where story diverges (think Choose-Your-Own-Adventure)
  Path) how we store chapters visited in order to implement History and Jump
  History) where users can see the text of what they've read so far without flipping through the panels
  Jump) allows users who have unlocked this feature by completing one path to jump back to previous chapters, so that they can explore other options without starting over
  Cheat) allows users who have unlocked this feature by completing one path to play the story without the location-based decision-making
