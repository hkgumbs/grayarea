# Gray Area

### Why did you make this?

I submitted the [original android app][] as my DCC capstone project in 2013.
I've come a ways since then, and I was interested in adapting it to the web.
You can find the original details in my [capstone documentation][].


### Can I play if I'm not in College Park, Maryland?

There is a back door to all of the location stuff.
Just use append `#cheat` to the URL, and you should be good to go!
