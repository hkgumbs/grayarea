I want to try the password on the original portal that disappeared
	Upon arriving at the blank wall, the portal reappears. I knew this password would be helpful. Stepping through the door again, I hope that the portal remains this time. Maybe I'll return.
	Back in the dorm, Ali and Tim have gotten over their argument. I wonder what the virtual versions of them would be like. They probably can't fight if they only speak when a question is asked. It would be cool to go find out. But for now, I'd prefer to remain in good old reality.
	- It's a nice day out. What'd you guys do last night?
	- [Tim] We ended up going to a friend's.
	- [Ali] Did you do anything interesting?
	- It's a funny thing that you ask...
	- [Tim] Guys, you have to see this hilarious cat video!
	- Yeah, nevermind.
	I think about the professor and everything he told me. Maybe I will contact him in reality. Find out more. Who knows?
