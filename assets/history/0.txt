Tutorial and Introcution
	When I left home to move into my dorm, it seemed like a big deal. At least my friends told me it was. So did my parents and my teachers, and my dog probably would have, too, if it could speak.
	Here I am, trying to meet everyone’s vague expectations about the college experience. My less-than impressive undergraduate life drags on and it still doesn't feel like any kind of big deal. So far, college basically means living in a room barely bigger than a closet and eating the least appetizing food in the universe. Go to class, almost fall asleep, go back to the dorm, do homework...fall asleep...again. 
I've made a couple friends in my dorm nonetheless. Ali and Tim - they’re dating.
	- Hey guys.
	- [Tim] Hey! Did you read the Diamondback today?
	- Have I ever?
	- [Ali] We’re not even sure you know how to read. I picked one up. Weird story on the front page.
	- [Tim] Exactly.
	- What’s the big deal?	
	- [Tim] A Diamondback reporter got the dirt on this secret project on campus. Administration’s trying to keep it covered up.
	- Sounds dumb.
	- [Ali] It seems kind of legit. The reporter went all Sherlock Holmes to get the scoop.
	- [Tim] You’re making it sound ridiculous. Basically they think it’s in some room in the Stamp. The reporter didn’t find the room, but when she started asking questions, UMD freaked out.
	- [Ali] Administration won’t respond to questions about it.
	- Sounds like a hoax. There’s no story to it.
	- [Tim] Maybe it’s like the college version of a publicity stunt. Trying to seem like they’re doing something important.
	- So they don’t know what it looks like?
	- [Ali] Try learning to read.
	- [Tim] There aren’t many details in here. Except that it’s rumored to be incomplete. Who knows what the point of it is.
	- Huh.
	- [Tim] Anyway - Ali, can you make it tonight?
	- [Ali] Not sure.
	- [Tim] You’re seriously considering not going?
	- [Ali] Yeah, it’s not like I want to follow you to a stupid party every night. 
	Here they go again - as usual, forgetting that I’m standing here. I decide to tune out and play a game on my phone. When they really start arguing, I head back to my room. I hate being around when the awkward silence ensues.
		
THAT NIGHT...
	I feel like an insomniac. It takes forever to fall asleep. It’s not stress or anything, more of a gnawing boredom. 
	Maybe I can figure out what that Diamondback story was about. It seems pretty lame, though. But I have nothing better to do and no one else will be wandering around Stamp right now.
