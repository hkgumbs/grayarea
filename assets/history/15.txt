I知 not leaving. I値l stay here
	I want to wait it out in the virtual world. Maybe when the virtual world is complete, there will be an open portal for people to move freely between reality and this. I won稚 be missing much in the real world while I知 here. Either way, if I go back to reality, the virtual may be forever closed to me. And in reality, my friends are fighting and my professors are assigning more tedious homework.
	Why not stay here?
	For me, the virtual world seems to encourage me to think. With all of the information at my fingertips, thinking is even more explorative than in reality. I知 learning about the things that I care about. When or if I do return to reality, I can pursue whatever I want to pursue.
