I need to see what my friends think about what's going on
IN THE DINER...
	Ali and Tim are both working on homework.
	- Hey guys!
	- What's going on?
	- [Tim] Homework.
	- Sweet, I can see that. What I mean is...do you notice anything strange about campus?
	- [Tim] No.
	- Seriously? Is it just me then? You don't see everything in a...distorted way?
	- [Ali] It always looks like this. 
	- [Tim] It's time to leave.
	What time is it? I suddenly know without checking my phone. It's 11:45 a.m. They turn and leave the room.
	- Where are you going? Can I come?
	- [Ali] We're going to Stamp.
	- [Tim] Of course you can come.
	- Okay, cool. So... you guys are all good now?
	- [Ali] Yes, and we always have been.
	- You don't remember your argument earlier?
	- [Tim] We didn't have an argument.
	- But I heard it. Tim, what is this, a joke?
	- [Tim] No, I'm not joking.
	They seem to be acting strangely and I'm utterly confused. They don't remember their fight. Am I the insane one? I can't really tell. I'm beginning to think walking through that door had a greater affect on campus than I first realized. Beyond the changed appearance, things just feel different. And here are my two closest friends, seeming a bit like different people altogether. Then again, it's kind of a cool change.
