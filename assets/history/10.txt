I’m bringing Ali and Tim with me
IN THE DINER...
	When I find Ali and Tim, they're not speaking to each other.
	- Let's pretend there's not an issue right now. I want to show you guys something in Stamp.
	- [Ali] Fine.
	- Now, it seems crazy, but...
IN STAMP...
	I go through the same steps that I did the first time. This time, I lead Ali and Tim through the portal.
	- [Tim] What's going on?
	- [Ali] This...does this have to do with the Diamondback story?
	- Yeah - it's a virtual version of campus.
	- [Tim] What does it do?
	- I'll show you guys.
