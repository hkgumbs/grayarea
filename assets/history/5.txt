I want explore on my own
	Instead of meeting with Professor Williams, I wander around campus. I study the people. Are they really people, though? They seem like they're real. The difference lies in the peace. Everyone is so peaceful. No one seems to argue, which seems like a good thing. A world without arguing sounds good to me. Of course, there are many people who would think that's terrible. It probably is terrible, and that's why this is just a virtual world.
	I end up at Hornbake Plaza. As students cross the space, no one crosses the exact center. At first, this seems like a small detail, but I notice that they purposefully avoid it. Why? I walk to the center of the plaza. There is something unmistakably strange about standing here. The people around look straight through me. I continue walking and find myself staring into the fountain on the mall. The students seem to avoid walking near the fountain, just like the center of Hornbake. They are unaware of its existence. Maybe I should investigate Hornbake again.
	Why can't they see the - 
	As I move to the center of Hornbake, I don't have time to finish my thought. The virtual world suddenly falls away, leaving me surrounded by reality. That was slightly ridiculous. So there's something about that spot. But can I go back? 

IN STAMP...
	I run to Stamp. There's the doorway again, and the monitor. I can go back later. But first...
