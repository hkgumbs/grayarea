George Williams probably knows what’s happening
IN CSIC…
	I find room 1101 and knock on the door. 
	- Excuse me.
	He doesn’t look up.
	- Excuse me. I’m looking for a, um, Professor Williams?
	The man turns to me, but his expression is blank.
	- Do you know Professor Williams?
	- [PW] Yes, I am Professor Williams.
	- I, well, messed with something…that I probably shouldn’t have…and now I don’t know what’s going on. Everything looks different.
	He doesn’t say anything. He just watches me. Or seems to. Maybe he’s busy thinking about something else.
	- Do you know what has happened to me?
	- [PW] Yes.
	- Well, what happened?
	- [PW] You have entered the virtual University of Maryland campus.
	- Oh. Okay. Wow. Technology these days…Am I going to be here forever?
	- [PW] You will be here until the virtual campus is complete.
	- What does that mean?
	- [PW] You have entered an incomplete virtual world. There is currently no exit for users without system administrator access.
	- Oh. Is that why the door – portal disappeared when I walked through it?
	- [PW] Yes.
	- So when will the campus be complete?
	- [PW] Based on the current timeline, one year.
	- I’m not sure I want to be here for an entire year.
	- What’s the point of this place anyway?
	- [PW] The purpose is academic investigation.
	- Huh. That’s very vague.
	- Is there any way for me to leave before the portal is complete?
	- [PW] It is possible.
	- Well how?
	- [PW] You will have to pretend to be a system admin.
	- How?
	- [PW] You can steal the password.
