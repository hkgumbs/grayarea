Start beating the system with Professor Williams
IN MCKELDIN...
	- Not to be rude, but why do you stare so much?
	- [PW] In the virtual world, people can only verbally respond when prompted by a question.	 
	- That sounds like a fairly important piece of information. Thanks for telling me. So what do I need to do?
	- [PW] You need the admin all-access password to exit.
	- So, do you know it?
	- [PW] Yes.
	- Having a conversation with you is impossible. May I have the password?
	- [PW] System security created by George Williams prevents me from disclosing it.
	- Aren’t you George Williams?
	- [PW] I am the virtual representation of George Williams.
	- Oh, uh, sweet. Cool. So you can’t give me the password. Then what are we doing here?
	- [PW] While system security prevents me from accessing the password and directly relaying it to you, being here in McKeldin gives me higher security clearance. 
	- Why?
	- [PW] McKeldin is the hub of the system, and most system information lies within these virtual walls.
	- Okay, so what can your grand security clearance here do to help me?
	- [PW] The fountain on the mall is programmed so that all people in the virtual world cannot see it. George Williams left the password there as a low-tech back up plan.
	- What do I do once I have the password?
	- [PW] Take it to Hornbake Plaza.
	- That’s all?
	- [PW] Yes.
	- Professor, once the virtual world is complete, who will be using it?
	- [PW] Faculty and staff of the University of Maryland will be using it.
	- No students?
	- [PW] No.
	- Huh. Well...thank you. Stay cool, virtual Professor Williams.
	I leave McKeldin to go to the fountain. When I look into the water, there is nothing written. I don’t see a key or any physical representation of a password. Instead I simply know it, just as I had known random information previously. Only here in the virtual world can information be accessed so quickly and seamlessly.
	I wonder what my friends would think of being here. I bet this password has more power than just a permanent escape from the system. Maybe the old portal can be reopened.
