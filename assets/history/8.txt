I want to return to reality and never come back
	Standing here, I observe the distorted virtual world for the last time. As I step into the center of Hornbake Plaza, the virtual fades away, and I become aware of reality surrounding me. In my mind, there is a comforting limit on what I know once again. If I want to discover information, I have to work to find it. Or use Google, or something.

IN THE DINER...
	I find Ali and Tim.
	- [Tim] Hey.
	- [Ali] How's it going?
	It's a relief that I don't need to ask them questions to hold a conversation.
	- It's a nice day out. What'd you guys do last night?
	- [Tim] We ended up going to a friend's place.
	Argument resolved. They're fine now. It's funny how much their conflicts affect me. I think I prefer arguments to a constructed, virtual world, void of conflicts. 
	- [Ali] Did you do anything interesting last night?
	- Nope.
	- [Tim] That's no fun. You should come with us next weekend!
	- Sounds good to me.
