I’m going to stick with Ali and Tim
IN STAMP...
	Lunch is peaceful – both Ali and Tim are much less abrasive, even less funny than usual. Still, I like being with my friends. Their normal selves still seem to be in there. They just have all-around calmer attitudes. Which is nice because they aren’t attacking each other...or me...at all.
	So maybe I’m in some alternate universe or something- with a different version of myself and my friends and campus.
	- Do you know where we are, exactly?
	My brain answers me: Adele H. Stamp Student Union, University of Maryland College Park, College Park, Maryland.
	- [Ali] We are at the Adele H. Stamp Student Union at the University of Maryland College Park in College Park, Maryland.
	Information comes to my mind immediately upon wondering about it. This can’t be real life.
	But that answer doesn’t help me determine if I’m in an alternate universe or not.
	Where can I find out about the disappearing doorway? McKeldin Library.
	Wait – why did the doorway disappear? But there’s no information in my head about that.
	- Do you want to go to McKeldin?
	- [Tim] Sure.

IN MCKELDIN...
	The computers don’t help at all. Instead, it is within the books that I find everything I want to know. From what I read, Computer Science Professor George Williams created this place – a virtual world. I guess I’m some sort of contemporary Tron, then. It is not yet complete. I recall the Diamondback article. I wonder when Professor Williams will complete it.
	- Why are the books full of notes instead of the original texts?
	- [Ali] We don’t know because we don’t read books.
	- [Tim] If necessary, we use computers.
	Of course, information is accessed immediately – they don’t even need to Google much of anything. There are pages upon pages of notes that don’t make sense to me. The only note that stands out is: back up escape password in the fountain on the mall.
	With Tim and Ali in tow, I leave McKeldin to go to the fountain. When I look into the water, there is nothing written. I don’t see any physical representation of a password. Instead I simply know it, just as I had known information previously. I consider my options.
